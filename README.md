# 19-Homework-Text-Editor-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I used Express.js and a MongoDB database to build an API for a hypothetical social network web application wherein users are able share their thoughts, react to othersâ€™, and create a friend list.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed Heroku page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. 

Said interaction/usage would involve simply using the text editor by creating/editing your own text and/or installing the application to do the same offline.
